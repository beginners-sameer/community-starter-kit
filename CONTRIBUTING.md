### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: this tells you dev is needed
- **qa-needed**: this tell you qa is needed
- **documentation-needed**: this tell you doc is needed
- **bug-high-priority**: this tell you bug high priority is needed
- **bug-low-priority**: this tells you bug low is needed
- **help-wanted**: this tells you help is wanted

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
